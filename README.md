# Abstract
In this research, we study the problem of Chinese stock market forecasting using traditional Neural Network methods, including Deep Feedforward Network, Convolution Neural Network(CNN), Recurrent Neural Network(RNN), Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) and we have also integrate with the Bi-direction technology. The purpose of this research is not to find a state-of-art algorithm to make the prediction more precise. We focus on the primary method and explore the relationship between architecture and hyper-parameter(including learning rate, variety of activation ,and variety of the output target designed. Due to the advanced of the Deep Learning method in decades, there is much active research in the Time-Serial Analysis domain, but we rarely not sure whether they are work in reality. The real market is a very sophisticated ecosystem, and many accidents may occur, influent the market price. Even there is an efficient market hypothesis from Eugene Fama, but we should not so sure we can control the market by this theoretical analysis. Although we implement the underlying deep neural network architecture, the experiment has a reassuring result with $31.9\%$ accuracy in the eight classes classification task and $68.6\%$ accuracy in the binary classification task.
